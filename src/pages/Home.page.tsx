          Inventory control handles products that are already in stock at the
          warehouse and plays a key role in supply chain management. Inventory
          control tools can categorize products by type, location and SKU (or
          serial number), audit data, generate reports in real-time and search,
          filter and view products. For more on inventory control methods,
          including expert advice, see our â€œEssential Guide to Inventory
          Control.

          <span className="text-2xl font-bold">Inventory Alerts:</span> Various
          modules trigger inventory alerts that help reduce waste, optimize
          inventory financials and manage customer expectations. These features
          include automated email or SMS messages that alert you to low
          inventory levels and shipment and supply chain delays. Inventory
          alerts offer an added level of operational control for sales
          forecasting, materials planning, shipping logistics and supplier
          management.

          Take inventory planning to a higher level with inventory optimization.
          Add sophistication to a basic inventory plan. Instead of standard
          ordering formulas and a basic ordering process, you can use tools that
          provide automated reports, inventory trends and a view of changes
          across the entire supply chain. This information enables a closer
          match in supply and demand so you can optimize the inventory on-hand.
